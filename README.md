- We use `index.vue` to show a list of all the galleries.
- We use `gallery.vue` to show a list of all objects in a gallery.
- We use `object.vue` to show the details of an object. Each object has a comment field that allows users to add comments.
- For the Personal Touch requirement, we used `sqlite3` to store object comments. These comments persist in the database even after when the server is restarted.
